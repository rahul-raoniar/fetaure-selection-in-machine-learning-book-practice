# This Repository Contains Various Types of Feature Selection Methods

`Repository Content`: This repository contains codes for various types of feature selection techniques used in machine learning.

* `Basic Methods`
    - Removing constant features or features with low variance
    - Removing quasi-onstant features 
    - Removing duplicate features
    - Removing correlated features

1. `Filter Methods`
    - Chi-square technique 
    - Anova based technique 
    - Correlation
    - Mutual Information
    - Single feature model
    - Target encoding

2. `Wrapper Methods`
    - Exhustive search
    - Forward feature selection
    - Backward feature elemination

3. `Embeded Methods`
    - Lasso 
    - Feature importance from decision trees
    - Recursive feature elemination by feature importance

* `Other methods`
    - Recursive feature addition
    - Recursive feature elemination
    - Feature shuffling

**Note**: These methods are listed based on feature selection book "Feature Selection in Machine Learning with Pythons" by Soledad Galli
